# Predicting-Stock-Prices-With-Linear-Regression
This is a project which shows analysis on the project where I'm predicting about the stock prices by using Linear Regression Algorithm. This project is done in Data Science by using Python for analysis.
To answer the question if we can accurately predict stock prices over time, I used Stock Price history data from the Quadl API and applied a regression analysis method.
